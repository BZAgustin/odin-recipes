    <h3>BORGER</h3>
    <p>Man I love burgers</p>
    <p>They're gonna kill me</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>8 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 large eggs<li>
        <li>4 large lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 avocados</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns. Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.</li>
        <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top each burger with 2 slices bacon and a Cheddar cheese slice; close the grill lid until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Remove patties from the grill.</li>
        <li>Place buns on the grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned, about 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Place 1 patty on the bottom half of each bun. Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is still runny, about 4 minutes. Immediately place 1 egg on top of each patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.</li>
    </ol>
